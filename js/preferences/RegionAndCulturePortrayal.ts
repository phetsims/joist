/**
 * A base class for the portrayal of people, places, or objects in the sim. Region and culture is a preference supported
 * by PreferencesModel and query parameters. The supported region and culture instances for a sim are defined by the
 * package.json object for the sim.
 *
 * Using the `regionAndCulture` query parameter:
 * The sim will set the value of the query parameter as the selected region and culture in preferences as long as the
 * option provided is supported by the sim. If the option provided is not supported by the sim a warning dialogue will
 * be shown at start-up
 * Options:
 * - `africa`
 * - `africaModest`
 * - `asia`
 * - `latinAmerica`
 * - `multi`
 * - `oceania`
 * - `usa`
 *
 * Example: `?regionAndCulture=asia`
 *
 * How to add portrayal sets to your sim:
 * 1. Add the supported regions and cultures to package.json. Ex. ( supportedRegionsAndCultures: [ 'usa', 'africa', 'asia' ] )
 *    The first element in the array will be the default value of the query parameter.
 * 2. Create a RegionAndCulturePortrayal instance for each supported region and culture. Generally a subclass is needed
 *    to extend the RegionAndCulturePortrayal class in order to add full support for the types of portrayals or poses
 *    each set may have.
 * 3. All RegionAndCulturePortrayal instances should be gathered as an array and added to the PreferencesModel
 *    localizationOptions.portrayals. The order of the array will be the display order of the regionsAndCultures
 *    displayed in the comboBox. It is advised that your portrayals array matches the order of the
 *    supportedRegionsAndCultures array.
 * 4. Implement the portrayal sets in the sim by listening to and using localizationModel.regionAndCulturePortrayalProperty
 *    in your PreferencesModel instance. This step is dependent on the sim and how it uses each portrayal. There is
 *    no "one size fits all" implementation. Some sims that provide examples of implementation are: number-line-integers,
 *    energy-skate-park, and area-model-algebra.
 *
 * Note: To support PhET-iO and preferences correctly, RegionAndCulturePortrayal instances should be created statically.
 *
 * As of 12/2023 the following are supported Region and Culture options and short descriptions of each:
 *  Africa: Portrayals of people, places, or objects that are inspired by the images and dress of the African region.
 *
 *  Africa (Modest): Similar portrayals to the Africa option, with adjustments to clothing or garb that is representative
 *  of more modest cultures in the region.
 *
 *  Asia: Portrayals of people, places, or objects that are inspired by the images and dress of the Asian region.
 *
 *  Latin America: Portrayals of people, places, or objects that are inspired by the images and dress of the Latin
 *  American region.
 *
 *  Multicultural: This option selects a random region/culture at startup to display as the default option for the sim.
 *  This means that a different portrayal will be set as the default for each refresh, but will remain the same through
 *  reset and any other sim interactions.
 *
 *  Oceania: Portrayals of people, places, or objects that are inspired by the images and dress of the Oceania region.
 *
 *  United States of America: Portrayals of people, places, or objects inspired by the images and dress of the United
 *  States of America. Although many other countries may also reflect this portrayal, as PhET being based in the USA, and
 *  having difficulty finding language that appropriately reflects all the regions where portrayals may match it was
 *  decided to keep "United States of America" as the descriptor with the understanding that other regions may see
 *  themselves reflected in the portrayals.

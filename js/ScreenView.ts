/**
 * The view portion of a Screen, specifies the layout strategy for the visual view.
 *
 * For the PDOM view, this type creates  the three organizing elements associated with each screen:
 * - The `ScreenSummaryNode` is introductory description that outlines the screen and sets the scene for the user.
 * - The `PlayAreaNode` holds content that is considered the main interaction and pedagogy to be learned from the screen.
 * - The `ControlAreaNode` houses controls and other content that is secondary to the main interaction. Ideally the user
 *       would encounter this after exploring the PlayAreaNode.
 * The screenSummaryNode instance is not available on the ScreenView, instead content can be added to it via a constructor
 * option or `ScreenView.setScreenSummaryContent`. This is because some accessible descriptions in the screen summary
 * are the same throughout all simulations. The pdomPlayAreaNode and pdomControlAreaNode instances are protected, read-only Nodes
 * that are meant to have their pdomOrder and children set to achieve the proper PDOM structure. Do not set
 * `pdomOrder` directly on the ScreenView, as ScreenView set's its own pdomOrder
